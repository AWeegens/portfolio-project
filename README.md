# cl-project

"This is my project for Code Louisville. It is a website about pregnancy (since I'm pregnant for the first time) that has three sections: 
1. Pregnancy Facts: This section will include a timeline and 'fun facts' about pregnancy that are generally unknown (unless you've been pregnant).
2. Pregnancy Reality: This section will be a blog or a forum that shares 'real' pregnancy stories. If it's a blog, it will allow users to comment. If it's a forum, it will allow users to post. 
3. Pregnancy Decisions: This section will outline some major decisions that need to be made during pregnancy or post-pregnancy and some basic information about those decisions. 

Project Requirements Met:
1. CSS: A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at deskto pand mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal, or is opened by clicking the "hamburger" menu item
-- This will be used for the 'menu' options (or the section headings). --
2. JavaScript: Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interation
-- On desktop version, click more to see more content about each of the sections. --
3. ? CSS: Use ":nth-child" or "nth-of-type" to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table
--This could be used to style different decisions in the Pregnancy Decisions section. --
4. ? JavaScript: Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation and displays the result on your page
-- In the Pregnancy Reality section, allow users to post either their due date and see how many days are left or put how many weeks along they are and see how many weeks are left. --"
