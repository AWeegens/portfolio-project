# cl-project

"This is my project for Code Louisville. It is a website about pregnancy (since I'm pregnant for the first time) that has three sections: 
1. Pregnancy Facts: This section will include a timeline of sorts and 'fun facts' about pregnancy that are generally unknown (unless you've been pregnant).
2. Pregnancy Reality: This section will be a blog that shares 'real' pregnancy stories. 
3. Pregnancy Decisions: This section will outline some major decisions that need to be made during pregnancy or post-pregnancy and some basic information about those decisions. 

The actual information may not be on the pages, but will allow the information to be easily added in the future.

Project Requirements Met:
1. JavaScript: Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interation
2. CSS: Use ":nth-child" or "nth-of-type" to style a series of elements on your page - for example, change the background color for every other row in a table
3. JavaScript: Create a JavaScript function that performs some form of mathematical operation and displays the result on your page
4. CSS: Use Flex ox or CSS Grid to organizae content areas based on mobile or desktop views. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on desktop
